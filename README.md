# Express server

###### Kat R. | CS 312 - Back-End Development for Multiplatform Applications

A **Node.js** server written in TypeScript using Express in the backend. This project is developed over time for successive/iterative assignments.

## Installation

Only a dev environment exists (for now?), so...

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i` in a terminal
3. To run the server normally, run `ts-node server.ts`
4. To monitor the server and restart it automatically when the code changes instead, run `npm run dev` _<sub>(or `nodemon server.ts`)</sub>_
