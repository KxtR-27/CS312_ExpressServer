# Express server

###### Kat R. | CS 312 - Back-End Development for Multiplatform Applications

A Node.js server using Express in the backend. This project is developed over time for successive/iterative assignments.

## Notes

- The script `npm run dev` uses Nodemon to reload the server every time the source code changes.  
  <sub><i>It goes without saying that this would be a bad idea for a larger server because restart times would be killer. Regardless, I'm saying it anyway.</i></sub>
- The `package.json` is structured/ordered to match the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json).
